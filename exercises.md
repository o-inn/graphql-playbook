# üìù Exercises (Pok√©mon API Edition)

Practice queries to build confidence with GraphQL using the

- Use **Pok√©mon GraphQL API** ‚Üí
  [https://graphql-pokemon2.vercel.app/](https://graphql-pokemon2.vercel.app/)
  for **read-only practice**.
- Use the **GraphQL Zero API**
  ([https://graphqlzero.almansi.me/api](https://graphqlzero.almansi.me/api)) for
  **mutations and CRUD practice**.

You can run these queries in **Apollo Sandbox** or any GraphQL playground.

---

## üü¢ Beginner

### 1. Simple Query

Fetch a Pok√©mon‚Äôs **number** and **name**.

```graphql
{
  pokemon(name: "Pikachu") {
    number
    name
  }
}
```

‚û°Ô∏è Modify it to also return the Pok√©mon‚Äôs classification.

### 2. Nested Query

Fetch a Pok√©mon‚Äôs name and its attacks.

```graphql
{
  pokemon(name: "Pikachu") {
    name
    attacks {
      special {
        name
        damage
      }
    }
  }
}
```

‚û°Ô∏è Modify it to also include the fast attacks.

### 3. List Query

Fetch the first 5 Pok√©mon with their number and name.

```graphql
{
  pokemons(first: 5) {
    number
    name
  }
}
```

‚û°Ô∏è Modify it to fetch the first 10 Pok√©mon instead.

## üü° Intermediate

### 4. Nested Data with Evolutions

Fetch a Pok√©mon‚Äôs name and its evolutions.

```graphql
{
  pokemon(name: "Charmander") {
    name
    evolutions {
      number
      name
    }
  }
}
```

‚û°Ô∏è Modify it to also include the types of each evolution.

### 5. Using Variables

Write a query with variables instead of hardcoding the Pok√©mon name.

```graphql
query GetPokemon($name: String!) {
  pokemon(name: $name) {
    id
    number
    name
    types
  }
}
```

With variables JSON:

```json
{
  "name": "Bulbasaur"
}
```

‚û°Ô∏è Change the variable to fetch Squirtle.

### 6. Fragments

Create a reusable fragment for Pok√©mon fields.

```graphql
fragment BasicInfo on Pokemon {
  id
  number
  name
}

{
  pokemon(name: "Eevee") {
    ...BasicInfo
    types
  }
}
```

‚û°Ô∏è Extend the fragment to also include the classification.

## ## üîµ Challenge (Pokemon)

### 7. Multiple Pok√©mon Query

Fetch two different Pok√©mon in the same query.

```graphql
{
  pikachu: pokemon(name: "Pikachu") {
    number
    name
  }
  bulbasaur: pokemon(name: "Bulbasaur") {
    number
    name
  }
}
```

‚û°Ô∏è Modify it to also fetch their attacks.

## ‚úçÔ∏è GraphQL Zero Exercises (CRUD Practice)

Now that you‚Äôre comfortable with queries, try mutations and CRUD operations
using GraphQL Zero: üëâ https://graphqlzero.almansi.me/api

## üü¢ Beginner (GraphQL Zero)

### 1. Fetch a User

Get a user‚Äôs id, name, and email.

```graphql
{
  user(id: 1) {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
```

‚û°Ô∏è Modify it to also fetch the user‚Äôs username and phone.

### 2. Fetch Posts

Get the first 3 posts (id + title).

```graphql
{
  posts(options: { paginate: { page: 1, limit: 3 } }) {
    data {
      id
      title
    }
  }
}
```

‚û°Ô∏è Modify it to also include each post‚Äôs body.

## üü° Intermediate (GraphQL Zero)

### 3. Create a Post

Create a new post for user 1.

```graphql
mutation {
  createPost(
    input: {
      title: "Learning GraphQL"
      body: "This is my first post!"
      userId: 1
    }
  ) {
    id
    title
    body
    user {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

‚û°Ô∏è Try changing the userId and see how it changes the result.

### 4. Update a Post

Update the title of post 1.

```graphql
mutation {
  updatePost(id: 1, input: { title: "Updated Title with GraphQL" }) {
    id
    title
    body
  }
}
```

‚û°Ô∏è Try updating both title and body.

### 5. Delete a Post

Delete post 1.

```graphql
mutation {
  deletePost(id: 1)
}
```

‚û°Ô∏è Confirm the deletion by querying post 1 again.

## üîµ Challenges (GraphQL Zero)

### 6. Create and Update a User

Create a new user.

```graphql
mutation {
  createUser(input: { name: "Alice GraphQL", email: "alice@example.com" }) {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
```

Update the same user‚Äôs email.

```graphql
mutation {
  updateUser(id: USER_ID, input: { email: "alice.updated@example.com" }) {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
```

‚û°Ô∏è Replace USER_ID with the id returned from the createUser mutation.

### 7. Chaining Queries

Fetch the first 2 users and their posts (title + body).

```graphql
{
  users(options: { paginate: { page: 1, limit: 2 } }) {
    data {
      id
      name
      posts {
        data {
          title
          body
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

‚û°Ô∏è Modify it to fetch comments for each post.

### üå± Next Steps

- Use Pok√©mon API for exploring queries and fragments.
- Use GraphQL Zero for practicing mutations and CRUD operations.
- Combine both to understand how GraphQL works across different APIs.
